# FreeUTM

FreeUTM is a project intended to recreate the features of the Mac-Exclusive [UTM](https://github.com/utmapp/UTM) for "free" operating-systems like Linux and BSD, hence the name FreeUTM.

## Future Goals
- Implement Options to Customize the Machine without having to learn QEMU arguments
- Create Graphical Version for either GTK or QT
- Support for other backends like [Distrobox](https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox), Docker, LXC, etc.
- Implement Guidance for GPU Passthrough Projects
- Release Packages to AUR and eventually be included in official repos.
