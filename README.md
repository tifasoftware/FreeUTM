# FreeUTM

FreeUTM is a project intended to recreate the features of the Mac-Exclusive [UTM](https://github.com/utmapp/UTM) for "free" operating-systems like Linux and BSD, hence the name FreeUTM.

If you have an issue with this program, reach out to us or the QEMU project, but not to the UTM or Turing Software.

## Future Goals
- Implement Options to Customize the Machine without having to learn QEMU arguments
- Create Graphical Version for either GTK or QT
- Support for other backends like [Distrobox](https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox), Docker, LXC, etc.
- Implement Guidance for GPU Passthrough Projects
- Release Packages to AUR and eventually be included in official repos.
